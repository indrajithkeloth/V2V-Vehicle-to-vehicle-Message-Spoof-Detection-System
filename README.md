# V2V-Vehicle-to-vehicle-Message-Spoof-Detection-System

This project is a **Streamlit-based real-time dashboard** that simulates and analyzes Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) messages to detect spoofed or anomalous data using both **rule-based logic** and a **machine learning model**.

Features

- Real-time simulation of V2V messages
- Rule-based spoof detection (e.g., unknown vehicle IDs, unrealistic speed)
- ML-based anomaly detection (unsupervised ML model)
- Live log of V2V messages
- Speed trend visualization (last 10 messages)
- Interactive map showing vehicle locations using Folium
- Visual distinction between normal and spoofed/anomalous data
